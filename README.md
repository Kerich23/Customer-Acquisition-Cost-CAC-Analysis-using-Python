# Customer-Acquisition-Cost-CAC-Analysis-using-Python

This repository contains Python scripts and a dataset to perform Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) analysis, exploring the efficiency and effectiveness of customer acquisition strategies across various marketing channels. The analysis is executed using Python within JupyterLab, leveraging Pandas, Plotly, and statistical methods to derive insights into acquisition costs and channel performance.

## Project Overview

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis is a critical aspect of business strategy, aiding companies in assessing the expenses associated with acquiring new customers through different marketing channels. This project demonstrates how Python, specifically JupyterLab, can be used to conduct in-depth CAC analysis and derive actionable insights.

## Key Steps in Analysis

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Dataset: `customer_acquisition_cost_dataset.csv`
   - Insights into dataset structure using Pandas

2. **CAC Calculation and Visualization**
   - Calculate CAC for each marketing channel
   - Visualize CAC distributions across channels using bar plots and scatter plots

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Generate summary statistics to compare CAC metrics across channels
   - Explore relationships between New Customers, CAC, and Conversion Rates

4. **Break-Even Analysis**
   - Calculate Break-Even Customers for each channel
   - Visualize Break-Even Customers to assess profitability thresholds

5. **Actual vs. Break-Even Comparison**
   - Compare actual customers acquired with Break-Even Customers for each channel

## Key Features

- Python-based Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis
- JupyterLab implementation for interactive analysis
- Pandas & Plotly for data manipulation and visualization
- Statistical insights into acquisition costs and channel performance
- Break-even analysis for profitability assessment
